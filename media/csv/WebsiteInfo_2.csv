Ain't Nobody Got Time for That - Why Pacing Your Degree can Lead to a Complete Education,Brian Commons      ,BUCH D323,30,Getting a degree doesn't have to be a four year sprint to the finish; taking the time now will make a world of difference for the future.,"Many students feel the pressure of finishing their degree and moving into the ""real world."" University is inherently a time for you to explore your options, get involved, and try new things. With the world of opportunity around you, it would be a shame not to take the time to stop and get everything you can from the experience.

Using my own experience of finishing a degree in six years, I want to encourage you to rethink the traditional degree, and reassure you that taking more time (if needed) is okay. However, using that time effectively is important so that you feel accomplished and inspired at the end of your degree. Extra-curriculars are so much more than padding for your resume - they can drastically change your plans post-graduation. Planning ahead and seriously thinking about what you want to gain from university can make your university experience and beyond a positive success story.

This session is especially valuable to emerging leaders or younger students looking for advice and mentorship.",Workshops 2,31,,,Brian Commons,,,

As leaders we try to go above and beyond our call of duty. In our attempts to do so sometimes we stop ourselves as a result of fear. We live in a culture of avoidance that prevents us from attaining meaningful experiences or creating a grander sense of purpose. 

This workshop aims to create an awareness of the limitations we place on ourselves and to find ways to challenge those limitations so that we *can* be infinite. ",Workshops 2,30,,,Jas Randhawa,,,

We will explore what 'reality' means to us and how we have the power to shape our reality and tap our full potential to create the inspiring life we want to live. We will also discuss the concepts of fixed vs. growth mindset and how they apply to the idea of self transformation.

In this workshop, we will help you make that crucial smalltalk with the boss, or with that cutie who sits by you in class.","This workshop will involve the collaboration of two essential factors in becoming a people's person: intrapersonal skills and interpersonal skills. 

You cannot understand others without having a sense of their feelings, and you can't understand their feelings if you can't recognize your own. With introspection, students will be given tools to be able to identify their emotions and better understand themselves. 

In the interpersonal segment, we will go over what makes good rapport, and they will be given tools to help them have productive smalltalk - making connections with people who might be potential friends or business partners. 

Activities throughout the workshop will not only get the students actively thinking about their own qualities, but they will also be given the opportunity to interact with many members in the workshop to practice these skills. 

Hopefully, by the end of the workshop some strangers will have become acquaintances, and it will be an example of how to break the ice of social anxiety and reservations.",Workshops 2,40,,,Melody Sinclair-Brooks &,Saem Park &,Amrit Nagra,

Brad and Caroline have been in a relationship for a year, and no, they're not the perfect couple.

Start with ""why""ù.","This workshop will explore how leading campus programs build dynamic, intentional teams. Often, teams decide first what they want to do, then how they want to do it. Very few get to why they do what they do. So what happens if you reverse the order: Why -> How -> What? The order of these events in the team building process matters.

United We Grow,Justine Munich      ,BUCH D307,30,"Average leaders gather a team together and get the job done. Exceptional leaders gather a team together and lead them to personal growth and expansion, producing proud and motivated team-mates.","One of the most important qualities in a leader is an ability to draw out the best in each team member and to create a sense of personal accomplishment and growth in each participant. Such a skill enhances employee retention, encourages participants to re-enroll in another year, and creates a reputation of a strong leader that not only gets work done, but benefits the individuals in the team as well. 

I will be drawing from eight years of tutoring experience, three years of dance instruction, and two years of experience running a franchise to lead a workshop on how to teach in an everyday context. This is a large part of what will make employees feel that working under you is worthwhile, and what separates one employer from another. You will send your employees, residents or camp members away feeling more confident and fulfilled than they came, and that is what will separate you from other employers, residence advisers and camp counsellors.

In today's job market, smaller companies can no longer afford to pay better than the big monoliths, so a manager needs to be competitive in other aspects to attract and retain employees. This ability to encourage personal growth and learning among employees can give you that edge.",Workshops 1,30,,,Justine Munich,,,
